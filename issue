### Describe the bug

Firstly I could not make out if this is supposed to happen or not, so it might not be a bug but a feature.
When using a compositor (i use Picom) windows that have a transparent background (like my terminal) will have a transparent border too. Windows that do not have a transparent background do not have a transparent border. This gives a inconsistent look.

### To Reproduce
in my .xinitrc:
```
picom --xrender-sync-fence &> /dev/null &
git/penrose-cody/target/debug/penrose-cody
```
Open windows of both types, firefox and st in my case.

### Expected behavior

Either the borders are all opaque or one can choose whether opaque borders are allowed.

### Screenshots

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
